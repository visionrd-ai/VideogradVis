**APPROACH**
1. ***Imports***:
   - The necessary libraries are imported, including OpenCV (cv2), PyTorch (torch), and its modules.

3. ***GuidedBackpropagation Class***: 
   - This class encapsulates the functionality for guided backpropagation.
   - During initialization (__init__), it takes the neural network model, the selected layer index, and the number of channels in the gradient layer as input.
   - It registers hooks on ReLU layers and the first convolutional layer to capture activations during forward and backward passes.
   - The visualize method takes input frames and an optional target class. It computes the guided backpropagation for the input frames and returns the reconstructed image.

4. ***Main Function* (main)**:
   - It loads the pre-trained video classification model and the input video frames.
   - The frames are converted into a tensor suitable for input to the neural network.
   - An instance of GuidedBackpropagation is created with necessary parameters.
   - Guided backpropagation is applied to each frame of the video using the visualize method.
   - The resulting heatmap is overlaid on the original video frames and saved as an output video.

5. ***Argument Parsing***:
   - Command-line arguments are parsed using the argparse module. These arguments include paths to input video, model weights, and output video, as well as parameters like selected layer, frame height, width, and clip length.

6. ***Execution***:
   - The script is executed, and the main function is called with parsed arguments.
